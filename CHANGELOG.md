## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-21

### 🔄 STREAMING RELIABILITY UPDATE - Enhanced Parser Resilience

#### Fixed
- **Streaming Parser Errors**: Resolved critical parsing failures with Claude 3.5 Haiku and other models
  - Fixed "Failed to parse streaming chunk" errors that forced fallback to non-streaming
  - Enhanced SSE boundary detection for both Unix (\n\n) and Windows (\r\n\r\n) line endings
  - Added graceful handling of unknown chunk types instead of crashing
  - Improved error messages with raw data preview for debugging
- **StreamingErrorChunk Error Conformance**: Now conforms to Swift's `Error` protocol for proper error handling
- **Future-Proofing**: Unknown chunk types are converted to error chunks rather than throwing exceptions
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive error reporting with detailed decoding breakdowns

#### Impact
- **Streaming Reliability**: All Claude models now stream correctly without parser failures
- **Better User Experience**: Eliminates forced fallbacks to slower non-streaming mode
- **Developer Experience**: Proper Swift error handling and enhanced debugging capabilities
- **Future Compatibility**: Graceful handling of new API features and chunk types

#### Migration
- Update to v1.1.2 for reliable streaming across all Claude models
- `StreamingErrorChunk` now throwable - update error handling if needed
- Enhanced error debugging available with detailed error messages

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-21

### 🚨 CRITICAL HOTFIX - Model Identifier Correction

#### Fixed
- **Claude 4 Model Identifiers**: Corrected model identifiers to match Anthropic API specifications
  - ❌ **Before**: `"claude-4-opus-20250522"` and `"claude-4-sonnet-20250522"` (causing 404 errors)
  - ✅ **After**: `"claude-opus-4-20250514"` and `"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` (official API identifiers)
- **HTTP 404 Resolution**: Fixed all API calls to Claude 4 models that were previously failing
- **Streaming Parser Resilience**: Enhanced streaming chunk parser to handle model-specific formats
  - Fixed parsing errors with Claude 3.5 Haiku and other models
  - Added graceful handling of unknown chunk types instead of crashing
  - Improved SSE boundary detection for both Unix (\n\n) and Windows (\r\n\r\n) line endings
  - Enhanced error messages with raw data preview for debugging
- **StreamingErrorChunk Error Conformance**: `StreamingErrorChunk` now conforms to Swift's `Error` protocol
- **Test Suite Updates**: Updated all tests to expect correct model identifiers and added streaming parser tests
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README with correct model identifiers, streaming troubleshooting, and fallback strategies

#### Impact
- **Breaking Issue Resolved**: All Claude 4 functionality now works correctly
- **Streaming Reliability**: Claude 3.5 Haiku and other models now stream correctly without parsing errors
- **API Compatibility**: SDK now matches official Anthropic API model identifiers
- **Better Error Handling**: Streaming errors are now properly typed and debuggable
- **Version Tracking**: Added comprehensive hotfix tracking in Version.swift

#### Migration
Users experiencing issues should:
1. **For Claude 4 404 errors**: Update to version 1.1.1 and clear Swift Package Manager cache
2. **For streaming parsing errors**: Update to v1.1.1 for enhanced error handling and parser resilience
3. **Error handling updates**: `StreamingErrorChunk` now conforms to `Error` protocol - update catch blocks if needed
4. Verify fixes with `SDKVersion.printVersion()` to confirm v1.1.1 installation
